        What is Fate Grand Order and why should I play it?
      </h1>
      <p>Fate is a massive franchise with tons of different anime, games, and movies.
        One of their most popular releases was this mobile game, "Fate Grand Order,"
        and it got so popular that it surpassed Fortnite in tweets on Twitter in 2019.
        It's a great time killer and the storyline and events are always interesting.
        There's always something new to do in the game, whether it be to grind to level
        up your characters or to farm on the new event. If you can get into the game, it
        becomes immensely fun, and the community is generally kind and supportive. The
        gameplay is simple, there's a well thought-out storyline, and the art is high
        quality. What more could you ask for?</p>

      <h1>
        Who am I to tell you to play Fate?
      </h1>
      <p>I am just a mere gamer. Fate is one of the few games I play, and I enjoy it
          greatly due to the simple mechanics of the game and the grinding aspect of
          Fate. The characters are all unique and since I've watched several of the
          anime before, I also love having the characters in the game I play. I love
          farming, I love grinding, and most of all, I love the gacha system. Although
          some people despise it due to the hell it gives them, I love the heaven and
          hell that this game's crappy rates give me. I mean, what fun would it be if
          you would always get what you wanted? The exhiliration of rolling the gacha
          and the anticipation you have when wondering whether it'll give you something
          amazing, or something absolutely horrible. I love rolling, and this is what
          led to my nickname with some of my friends online, "EX Rank Gacha Junkie."
          I currently have a 400+ day login streak on Fate and have no intention of
          giving that up anytime soon. #TheGrindDontStop
